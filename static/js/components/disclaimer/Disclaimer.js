          Dypius is a decentralized platform that people can use for yield
          farming, staking, and enabling users to leverage the advanced trading
          tools of the DYP. Your use of the Dypius involves various risks,
          including, but not limited to, losses while digital assets are being
          supplied to the Uniswap / PancakeSwap / Pangolin protocol and losses
          due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a liquidity pool. Before
          using the Dypius, you should review the relevant documentation from
          our Github to make sure you understand how the Dypius works. The
          Dypius project is public, open-source or source-available software
          including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum
          Blockchain, BNB Chain, and Avalanche Network.

          Additionally, just as you can access email protocols such as SMTP
          through multiple email clients, you can access the Dypius through
          dozens of web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible for doing your
          own diligence on those interfaces to understand the fees and risks
          they present.
